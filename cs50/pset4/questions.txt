0.  BITMAP(BMP) = 16 Million (True Color) 
    JPEG = 16 Million (True Color)
    GIF = 256 Per Frame (High Color)
    PNG = 256 Terracolors (Scientific Colors)
1.  GIF
2.  lossless = if all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed.
    lossy = Some of the data is lost during compression.
3.  JPEG
4.  You're telling the system you can now use that memory again.  But You're not actually deleting anything.  To do that
    you would need to actually overwrite the memory.
5.  Change all of the bits to 1's
6.  The <stdint.h> header shall declare sets of integer types having specified widths,
  and shall define corresponding sets of macros. It shall also define macros that specify limits of integer types 
  corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.
7.  Limits the width of binary intigers that are allowed to represent a number.
8.  BYTE 8-BIT, DWORD & LONG 32 BITS AND WORD IS 16-BIT
9.  bfType = Indicating a bitmap file. BM
10. bfsize = the size of the BMP image + the size of the headers.
    bisize = The number of bytes required by the structure (struct)
11. It's origin is in the top left corner. It's top-down
12. biBitCount of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits.
13. If there's no outfile given to the program.  This is a check not to write in space that doesn't belong.
14. It's reading piece by piece.
15. Because three is != / 4
16. skips over padding if there's any.
17. to indicate whether the offset is relative to the the current file position
18. It's your TA holding a cat.
